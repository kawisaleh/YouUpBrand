The website comprises of what services we offer as well as informing them of what the future holds regarding the events that we are organising. The pre-launch will be able to bring our team’s vision and values to life, which will lead to attracting the right audience which are 40-50-year-old middle aged singles who are looking for a sense of adventure in their dating lives.<br><br><strong>Colour scheme<br></strong>As our team strived to go for lively colours in comparison to the dating market that uses undersaturated colours, we concluded upon choosing a colour palette that included the colour carmine red, orange, white, and beige. Orange defines spontaneity and creativity which intertwines with red that signifies passion, love, liveliness, and adventure, which intertwine with our brand’s visions. In addition, white signals clarity and openness whilst beige symbolises tranquillity and modernism as well as giving the brand an inviting and trending feel. The first version of the lean canvas states that the customer segments are 40-50-year-old middle aged singles who consist of men and women, thus we chose these lively colours to bring the under-saturation of the current digital dating world to life.<br><br>Carmine red: #C91716<br><br>Orange: #D97143<br><br>Beige: #F0C9B9<br><br>White: #FFFFFF<br><br><strong>Font choices<br></strong>Our team decided to choose lively yet modern fonts such as Jost, Schibsted Grotesk Medium 500 and Schibsted Grotesk SemiBold 600 spontaneously whilst preparing for our Marketing presentation. The reasons as to why we chose these innovating fonts is because Schibsted Grotesk SemiBold 600 compliments our website’s headers exquisitely whilst maintaining a sleek look – we want to be able to compel our consumers to sign up via our website as well as staying satisfied during their scrolling sessions. Though we chose Schibsted Grotesk Regular 400 was chosen as our main font first, we decided to go for the font 'Jost' to upkeep the website’s conciseness and functionality and also allow consumers that visit our website to have an overly satisfactory readability level. As our team strives to compel 40 to 50-year olds that seek thrill and excitement, the fonts mentioned above give a sense of enthrallment; this aligns with the mood that we want to extract from our team to the consumers of fun and joy.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>User interface patterns<br></strong>The first interface element that was used in our website is called the dropdown menus, which is on the landing page of our website. Since the template already came with dropdown menus, our team made sure to make maximum use of them to ensure that our brand identity and visions are showcased to all people visiting the website. Our team kept the cognitive load of the website to a minimum to ensure an easy and efficient experience during the design aspect of the website. In addition, there are also buttons in the hero section of our page to compel users on the website to visit our other forms of social media.<br><br>As our target audience are 40-50-year-old middle aged singles, we want to ensure that all our other social media platforms are available for them if they want to keep up with our services. There are text fields on the landing page as well as the other pages to add crucial forms of information to inform our users of what our services are about. Icons are also placed next to the dropdown menus of our company’s logo to add brand identity and to make the company’s logo memorable towards the consumers on the website. The icon is also hyperlinked for users who visit other pages from the landing page to bring them back to the main page for efficiency. The third version of the lean canvas states that our solution is to create a brand where our target group can create connections without the need for digital dating apps, thus having the necessary icons on the hero page which are hyperlinked to our YouTube and Facebook channels are crucial.<br><br><strong>Organisation of navigation and content<br></strong>With the use of Information Architecture (IA), we were able to create a successful landing page consisting of dropdown menus in order to bring the brand’s vision and mission to life. The menu system is placed clearly on the landing page for all users to easily navigate as our target audience consist of 40-50-year-old middle aged singles who have a comfortable to higher income, which indicates their higher level of knowledge in technology. By ensuring easy and navigable dropdown menu and hamburger menu, we allow users to explore the website freely whilst being informed on what the website and brand has to offer. The main page has an image of what the YouUp? brand is represented as, which is a skyscraper in which our intended target audience will visit to find their potential dating partners. Furthermore, our team made sure that the Responsive Design was efficient as the website needs to adhere to various screen sizes and devices such as smartphones and laptops.<br><br><strong>Credits</strong><br>Image credits to:<br><br><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/ZDN-G1xBWHY" class="text-primary" target="_blank">https://unsplash.com/photos/ZDN-G1xBWHY</a><br><br><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/nF8xhLMmg0c" class="text-primary" target="_blank">https://unsplash.com/photos/nF8xhLMmg0c</a><br><br><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/ULHxWq8reao" class="text-primary" target="_blank">https://unsplash.com/photos/ULHxWq8reao</a><br><br><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/-HMZXzgt798" class="text-primary" target="_blank">https://unsplash.com/photos/-HMZXzgt798</a><br><br><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/elderly-women-celebrating-a-party-8088248/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">https://www.pexels.com/photo/elderly-women-celebrating-a-party-8088248/</a><br><br><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-group-of-friends-having-fun-6950693/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-group-of-friends-having-fun-6950693/</a><br><br><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-group-of-elderly-people-clinking-glasses-6950719/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-group-of-elderly-people-clinking-glasses-6950719/</a><br><br><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/man-and-woman-happily-talking-to-each-other-5778907/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">https://www.pexels.com/photo/man-and-woman-happily-talking-to-each-other-5778907/</a><br><br><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/man-and-woman-sitting-on-chair-4255482/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">https://www.pexels.com/photo/man-and-woman-sitting-on-chair-4255482/</a><br><br><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/people-eating-popcorn-at-a-cinema-7991275/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">https://www.pexels.com/photo/people-eating-popcorn-at-a-cinema-7991275/</a><br><br><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/couple-holding-popcorn-watching-a-movie-7234275/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">https://www.pexels.com/photo/couple-holding-popcorn-watching-a-movie-7234275/</a><br><br>Template credits to:<br><a href="https://mobirise.com/builder/web-design-program.html" class="text-primary" target="_blank">https://mobirise.com/builder/web-design-program.html</a><br><br><strong>Testing Report<br></strong>In order to ensure that our clients receive and visit the best possible website, we have conducted four user tests to assess whether our website meets our objectives. Our test group consisted of participants between the ages of 41 and 45, which aligns with our target audience demographic of individuals between the ages of 40 and 60. Thus, our testing goals are to give a highly satisfactory user and customer experience, and to ensure a Responsive Web Design. Participants were instructed to complete the following tasks: <br><br>1. Navigate to the 'About Us' section of the website. <br>2. Navigate to the 'Our Team' section of the website. <br>3. Navigate to the 'Locations' section of the website. <br>4. Scroll through the homepage of the website. <br>5. Locate the section that describes our brand values. <br>The purpose of these tasks were to test the following aspects of our website: <br>1. The ease with which participants could navigate information about our company and our values. <br>2. The placement of images and links throughout the website. <br>3. Whether participants could gain insights into our brand and its values by simply scrolling through the website. <br>4. The overall readability and design of the website.<br> <br>We began the testing process by asking participants to complete the above tasks. Our aim was to measure the user-friendliness of our website and the speed with which participants were able to complete the tasks. Our team invited all of the intended target audience to come to Breda University of Applied Sciences to be able to gather them and attain results efficiently. The videos were recorded with an iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. Based on the feedback provided, we implemented changes to our website in order to improve its user-friendliness and overall design. <br>From the testing we were able to conclude the following:<br> <br>1. Users were happy with the overall look and feel of the website. They were able to navigate through the website under two minutes as well as successfully following all the tasks that were given.  <br>2. Participant 1 mentioned the readability of the text on the home page – they wanted the text to be a bit bigger. What we would have implemented on the website are bigger texts, especially on the home page to satisfy our target audience in the future. <br>3. However, users informed us of the simplicity of the website – they wanted us to have more of a design on the website, the home page in particular. In the future, we would have added more UI/UX designs such as icons, bold font headers, and pictures on the home page.&nbsp;<br></p>

                                <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-4"><strong>Context of your campaign and promotional activities done. What is your brand about, what did you do in terms of promotional activities? What channels/platforms are used and how does the campaign link to the objectives established in the Communication &amp; Media Plan.<br></strong><br>To begin, our group discussed how we would be able to reach middle aged singles who are 40-50 years old. Our brand, YouUp?, is about establishing unique connections with one another in a nostalgic sense, as the dating life used to be more saturated, authentic, and fun. We want to be able to bring fun back to the dating market, which can be a big step for middle aged people, especially the ones who are only one step away from entering an adventure of their lifetime. Since the dating market has become digitalised since the early 2000s, it has become undersaturated, repetitive, and more intense. What this brand wants to bring is a sense of comfort, happiness, nostalgia, adventure, and fun into the lives of middle aged singles. We chose to use Facebook as our primary platform, which is mentioned in the Communication &amp; Media Plan, because according to a graph called Distribution of Facebook users as of July 2022 by Statista (2022), 16.5% of 35-44 year old citizens in the Netherlands use Facebook as well as 15.2% of 45 to 54 year olds using Facebook. That percentage of Facebook users have a chance of coming across a brand that offers joy, uniqueness, and opportunities. Moreover, Shepherd (2023) mentions how 73% of Generation X use Facebook, which is why we decided to make it our primary platform. Although Whatsapp is more used amongst Generation X, we were unfamiliar with the business aspects as well as most of our team members having familiarity with Facebook more. However, we will look into the business aspects of Whatsapp in the future as O'Niell (2023) mentions how you can add automated messages and reply quickly to customers, which can make it feel more personal.<br> <br>When it comes to promotional activities, our team decided to take a different approach for the redo in which we used the hashtag #TogetherIsPrecious to encourage people on our chosen platform Facebook to comment and engage with our page. We made a post in which people had to comment their favourite memory under that hashtag. Our second promotional activity was a raffle, thus once someone followed our Facebook page, they automatically enter a competition of winning free tickets to our first event for our service. Firstly, we had also decided to add YouTube as a channel to use, but for the redo, we decided to remove YouTube to fully focus on Facebook as well as analysing the reach and engagement with our posts. We have three objectives from our Communication &amp; Media plan:<br><br>- <strong>Reach objective:</strong> To reach 250 40-50-year-olds in the target audience through Fac﻿ebook by the 9th of June 2023.<br>- <strong>Affect objective:</strong> To increase brand awareness and engagement of the brand among our target audience by 5% by 9 June 2023.<br>- <strong>Response objective:</strong> To generate 50 likes across the platform Facebook by 9th of June 2023.<br><br>The campaigns link to the objectives mentioned above as the usage of the hashtag #TogetherIsPrecious increases brand awareness as well as engaging our audience of what our brand is about, which can also create loyalty. Furthermore, the Meta Business Suite showed that we had generated 71 likes across the platform Facebook, in which the two posts that encouraged people to include the hashtag #TogetherIsPrecious in the comments had reached 65 people, and the second one, that also included hashtags such as #YouUpEvents, reached 127 people. Another post that asked people to comment who they would bring to the event reached 63 people, which concludes that interacting with our audience increases engagement. The affect objective, which mentions increasing brand awareness and engagement of the brand among our target audience by 5%, meant that we had to reach 12 to 13 people of the 250, in which we successfully did. <br>Learning Points are identified. Based on your objectives, strategy and planning, you detail your experiences. What did you learn? What did you expect and what didn’t you expect in terms of execution of your Communication &amp; Media Plan? <br>As previously stated, our objectives were:<br><br>- <strong>Reach objective:</strong> To reach 250 40-50-year-olds in the target audience through Fac﻿ebook by the 9th of June 2023.<br>- <strong>Affect objective:</strong> To increase brand awareness and engagement of the brand among our target audience by 5% by 9 June 2023.<br>- <strong>Response objective:</strong> To generate 50 likes across the platform Facebook by 9th of June 2023.<br><br>To make sure we had an adequate planning and strategy on Facebook, Marcus Mac Donald and I chose to use Meta Business Suite to schedule our posts. By doing so, we were able to efficiently and effectively post at specific times. We scheduled our posts as so:<br><br>Upon researching, we came across a website suggesting specific times to post on Facebook to get the most engagement. According to Geyser (2023), the best times to post on Facebook are:<br><br>Monday: 9:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 3:00 PM<br>Tuesday: 9:00 AM, 11:00 AM , 3:00 PM<br>Wednesday: 9:00 AM, 10:00 AM , 1:00 PM, 4:00 PM<br>Thursday: 9:00 AM, 11:00 AM , 4:00 PM<br>Friday: 11:00 AM, 4:00 PM, 6:00 PM<br><br>Thus, our team implemented those times to our best abilities. On Tuesday (6 June), we posted around 15:00 and 16:00, which reached quite a lot of engagement. On Wednesday (7 June), we posted around 14:00, 16:00, and 21:00. Lastly, we posted at 09:00 AM, 12:15 PM, 14:00, 15:00, and 16:00 on 8 June. The posts did surprisingly well at 09:00 AM, which we did not expect. We first expected the posts to receive more engagement during the late afternoon. What we also did not expect, as mentioned in our Communication &amp; Media plan, is that we could not see the ages of our target audience on Meta Business Suite unless you reach 100 followers. Before the redo, we had around 25 followers. After the redo and the new campaign, we managed to have 30 likes and 31 followers on our Facebook page in a short amount of time, which was surprising. Because of the usage of hashtags such as #TogetherIsPrecious and the engaging posts such as asking people to comment their most precious memories as a chance to win free tickets to our event, we managed to get more engagement, which aligns with our objectives of generating 50 likes across the platform Facebook by 9 June 2023.<br> <br>What we learned was how efficient and effective scheduling posts can be via Meta Business Suite, which we will implement in future projects. Also, we learned how it is a bit more difficult to get followers and likes on Facebook in comparison to Instagram, which can be shared easier amongst individuals. What we also learned was to keep the design of the posts cohesive and within the same colour palette we had chosen, which made the posts look organised. Also, we learned how to use Meta Business Suite, which gives a clear outline of our insights, reach, engagement, scheduling, checking notifications, and insights. Being able to have a clear insight of all these aspects allowed us to successfully reach all our goals in the Media &amp; Communication plan. What we would do differently next time is to make even more posts in the morning, especially around 09:00 AM, as we had an unexpected amount of reach (127 people in the matter of a few days), in comparison to the afternoon (16:00). <br><br><strong>Future  Planning.  You  reflect  on  what  has  been  done  and  you  would  provide  a  detailed description what you would do in the future if the project would continue. What would you do differently and why?</strong><strong><br></strong><br>During our promotion period, we have actively promoted our brand on Facebook with the goal of increasing our target audience's overall engagement with our brand. We have witnessed that although we had a pretty significant reach, we didn't achieve a lot of engagement. We believe the reason for this is that our call to action was either not there or not clear enough. Most of the posts were dedicated to strengthening the theme of our brand by using fun facts about human connection. These did nor resonate with those not interested in fun facts.<br> <br>In the future, we would like to make posts where the information will be more relevant and more directed specifically toward our target audience. We will also spread our posts more organically. Currently, our posting frequency was quite high because we wanted to get the most engagement in the least amount of time, however, we are not sure if more frequent posting will achieve this result. Rather than that posting at the right times will make sure the posts get delivered to the right people. By using the Meta Business Suite, we would carry on posting until we get 100 followers to be able to gain insights into which posts attract our target audience the most.<br><br><strong>Professionalism. It is expected of you to make sure all and every promotional activity you have  done  is  present  on  the  website.  That  means  all  posts,  images,  and  other  forms  of created content. It needs to be of high quality and explained.<br></strong> <br>We have three different kinds of posts that we were actively promoting during our campaign. Those three types were promotional posts dedicated to promoting our brand, informational posts dedicated to giving fun facts about love and connection, and lastly, posts to excite our target audience about our product. The posts dedicated to promoting our brand are important for creating a bond between our consumers and us as a company. We want the consumers to know our brand and what we stand for. They have to hear our names and instantly make the connection to who we are.<br>Our idea about the fun facts is to keep our content playful and informational while still being very closely related to what we want to promote. Our brand is focused on connection and diving deeper into the science and history of connection might be interesting for like-minded people to read.<br><br>Finally, it is of course also important to inform our consumers about what we are eventually planning to sell to them. It was not at the forefront of our promotion, so we thought it might be nice to give the consumers a sneak peek of what's to come.<br><br>To see the pictures and promotional activity, click <a href="page6.html#gallery2-1x" class="text-primary">here</a>.<br>Click <a href="https://edubuas-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/210008_buas_nl/EfsBGzpTrx9KoLPsT74mzwgB4fL_cMAvffT1gou-QKBNyQ?e=L5Bc29" class="text-primary" target="_blank">here</a> to see the content calendar.<br>Link to our Facebook page is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100090911655749" class="text-primary" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br><strong>References<br></strong><br>Geyser, W.

Some of the alternatives we considered were:<br><br>- Love Skyscraper: This option conveys the sense of adventure and excitement that our target audience is seeking in their dating experience. It also aligns with our brand vision of building authentic connections as it implies that the platform is specifically designed for those who are looking for a sense of euphoria and meaningful relationships.<br>- YouDown: This option combines the concepts of connection and adventure, suggesting that our platform is a quest for building genuine relationships in an authentic and nostalgic way. It indicates a sense of exploration and discovery, which resonates with our target audience’s desire for adventure.<br><br>After considering the options carefully, we concluded with YouUp? for our dating platform as we were certain that it best encapsulated our brand vision and resonated with our target audience’s desire for freedom in their dating experiences. “YouUp?” indicates a sense of authenticity in the way others connect with each other, which aligns with our brand positioning.<br><br>Moreover, we conducted research in order to ensure that the trademark that we had chosen was not in use by other existing dating platforms or companies to avoid any legal conflicts in the future.<br><br>Lastly, the choices that were made regarding the creation of the trademark for our dating platform were based on an analysis of our target audience’s preferences and our brand vision. “YouUp” indicates a sense of nostalgia, enthrallment, and adventure for 40-50 year olds who seek love.<br><br>Link to justification of the lean canvas:<br><br><a href="https://edubuas-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/210008_buas_nl/EskEQ1qfQO1FlG4Jdt8gsv8BiDeNCt1fVPJxFZVF4KwARg?e=729Mpa" class="text-primary" target="_blank">https://edubuas-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/210008_buas_nl/EskEQ1qfQO1FlG4Jdt8gsv8BiDeNCt1fVPJxFZVF4KwARg?e=729Mpa</a><br></p>
